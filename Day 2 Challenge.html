        <p align="left">
            Vision impairment can range from no vision – blindness – or very low vision to an inability to see particular colours.
        </p>

        <p align="left">Vision impairment can happen at any age. Some conditions might result in vision problems for only a short time, but most vision conditions in children stay the same throughout life. Other conditions get worse over time, resulting in poorer vision or blindness as children get older.</p>

        <p align="left">Babies might have vision impairment at birth. It can also happen later as a result of disease, injury or a medical condition.</p>

        <p align="left">The most common causes of vision impairment are:</p>
           <ul align="left"> 
                <li> Neurological conditions that affect the parts of the brain that control sight (cortical vision impairment)</li>
                <li> Conditions like albinism and retinitis pigmentosa </li>
                <li> Illnesses that happen to some very premature babies or to babies that have particular problems during birth </li>
                <li> Like paediatric glaucoma or cataracts and cancers like retinoblastoma </li>

            <h3> Fun Learning Application by Code to Enhance Learning</h3>

            <p> 
                
                Code to Enhance Learning has developed an application to play the sounds of letter by creating different events. Visually impaired children face challenges that can stop them becoming involved in learning activities at nursery and school, leading to dependence on adults and reducing the benefit of playtime. We are exploring the use of an scratch application for young children, which uses sound to help them overcome these challenges through better awareness of their surroundings.

                There are many people around us who have different types of visual problems. Some can’t read small print while others can’t see objects at a distance. Well, all of these visual problems can be solved with the help of eyeglasses, contact lens or a magnifier. 

                But what about the people who are blind? What if I told you that people who cannot see at all can too read and write? Yes, there is a system called as“Braille”. Braille has raised dots which helps understand the character of an alphabet or a number.
